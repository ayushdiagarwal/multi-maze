# Maze Game

This is a simple multiplayer maze game where players can move around a maze and interact with other players in real-time. The maze is generated using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm, and the game uses WebSockets for real-time communication between clients.

## ToDo

- [ ] Make sure that when two sockets are connected they get the same maze instead of a newly generated one
- [ ] Add collision detection of the player with the walls
